🎵 Musical Instrument Studio (Scratch Project)
📌 Project Overview

Musical Instrument Studio is an interactive Scratch project where users can play different virtual musical instruments using the keyboard. The project provides a fun and engaging way to explore sounds while learning how keyboard events, sprites, and backdrops work in Scratch.

🖥️ Project Flow

The project starts with an instruction backdrop that explains how to play the instruments.

After viewing the instructions, users move to the main studio stage.

Users can then play different instruments by pressing the assigned keys on the keyboard.
